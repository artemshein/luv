Luv 0.3alpha
============

Luv is Lua (lua.org) MVC web-framework. Luv is open-source and
completely free for both commercial and non-commercial use. Luv current
version has an "alpha" status and not advised to use it on production.

Luv:
- is much faster then any PHP, Ruby, or Python frameworks;
- has simple and flexible API;
- is complete solution for any REST web-service.

Luv requirements:
- mod_rewrite (Apache, LightTPD) or something similar on your web-server
for CGI support;
- datafilter (http://www.daizucms.org/lua/library/datafilter) for MD5 &
SHA1 passwords hashing;
- LuaSQL (www.keplerproject.org/luasql/) with mysql driver for MySQL
support.
- LuaSocket for SCGI support.

Luv includes:
- table, string and debug extensions;
- Prototype-based OOP;
- Exceptions;
- CGI, SCGI;
- Unit-testing libs;
- "Tamplier" template engine written in pure Lua;
- Fields (with Validators), Models & Forms;
- URLconf (URL to action binding);
- Widgets (representation layer);
- Databases:
	- MySQL only in this version;
	- placeholders;
	- DBMS agnostic interface;
	- Models with relations;
- ... will be much more soon ...

How to install
==============
1. You will need Lua 5.1.x.
For Ubuntu:
	sudo apt-get install lua5.1
For Windows:
	Download Lua from http://luabinaries.luaforge.net/download.html and
	then install it.
2. You will also need a web-server with mod_rewrite, CGI or SCGI support
(for example Apache with mod_rewrite or LightTPD with mod_rewrite).
3. datafilter library for Lua is required:
You can get last binaries from
http://www.daizucms.org/lua/library/datafilter/
4. Get MySQL 5.x server:
Ubuntu:
	sudo apt-get install mysql-server-5.0
Windows:
	Download binary from http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/
4. LuaSQL with MySQL support:
Ubuntu:
	sudo apt-get install liblua5.1-sql-mysql-2
Windows:
	Download and install binaries from
	http://luaforge.net/frs/?group_id=12
5. Copy Luv files to other lua libraries (often /usr/lib/lua/5.1/) into
luv/ directory (/usr/lib/lua/5.1/luv/).
6. Configure web-server mod_rewrite:
LightTPD:
	Uncomment "mod_rewrite" in server.modules. Add ".lua" to
	static-file.exclude-extensions and place
	$HTTP["host"] =~ "your host here" {
		url.rewrite = ("^/(?!(css/|images/|js/))" => "/index.lua")
	}
	somewhere in the config file (lighttpd.conf).

Manual or API reference
=======================
There are no manuals or references to Luv for now. First of all you can
read unittest scripts from tests/ directory for use cases. Second you
can read Luv sample project code (http://github.com/temiy/adspace).
Third you can read Django (djangoproject.com) manuals and references.
Luv is mostly similar in main design ideas with Django. And the last
you also can send me your questions.
