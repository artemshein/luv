How to install
==============
1. You will need Lua 5.1.x.
	For Ubuntu:
		sudo apt-get install lua5.1
	For Windows:
		Download Lua from http://luabinaries.luaforge.net/download.html
		and install it.
2. You will also need a web-server with mod_rewrite, CGI or SCGI support
(for example Apache with mod_rewrite or LightTPD with mod_rewrite).
3. datafilter library for Lua is required:
	Ubuntu:
		sudo apt-get install liblua5.1-datafilter0
	Windows:
		Get last binaries from
		http://www.daizucms.org/lua/library/datafilter/
4. Get MySQL 5.x server:
	Ubuntu:
		sudo apt-get install mysql-server-5.0
	Windows:
		Download binary from http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/
5. LuaSQL with MySQL support:
	Ubuntu:
		sudo apt-get install liblua5.1-sql-mysql-2
	Windows:
		Download and install binaries from
		http://luaforge.net/frs/?group_id=12
6. Copy Luv files to other lua libraries (often /usr/lib/lua/5.1/) into
luv/ directory (/usr/lib/lua/5.1/luv/).
7. Configure web-server mod_rewrite:
	LightTPD:
		Uncomment "mod_rewrite" in server.modules. Add ".lua" to
		static-file.exclude-extensions, place
------------------------------------------------------------------------
$HTTP["host"] =~ "your host here" {
	url.rewrite = ("^/(?!(css/|images/|js/))" => "/index.lua")
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------
		and (only for CGI)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
cgi.assign = ( ".lua" => "/usr/bin/lua" )
------------------------------------------------------------------------
		somewhere in the config file (lighttpd.conf).

Manual or API reference
=======================
There are no manuals or references to Luv for now. First of all you can
read unittest scripts from tests/ directory for use cases. Second you
can read Luv sample project code (http://github.com/temiy/adspace).
Third you can read Django (djangoproject.com) manuals and references.
Luv is mostly similar in main design ideas with Django. And the last
you also can send me your questions.
