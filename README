Luv 0.2dev
==========

Luv is Lua (lua.org) MVC web-framework. Luv is open-source and completely
free for both commercial and non-commercial use. Luv current version has
a "development" status and not advised to use anywhere.

Luv:
- is much faster then any PHP, Ruby, or Python frameworks;
- has simple and flexible API;
- is complete solution for any REST web-service.

Luv requirements:
- mod_rewrite (Apache, LightTPD) or something similar on your web-server
for CGI;
- datafilter (http://www.daizucms.org/lua/library/datafilter) for MD5 & SHA1
passwords hashing;
- LuaSQL (www.keplerproject.org/luasql/) with mysql driver for MySQL support.
- (optional) LuaSocket for SCGI.

Luv includes:
- Table, String and Debug extensions;
- Prototype-based OOP;
- Exceptions;
- CGI, SCGI;
- Unit-testing libs;
- "Tamplier" template engine written in pure Lua;
- Fields (with Validators), Models & Forms;
- URLconf (URL to action binding);
- Widgets (representation layer);
- Databases:
	- MySQL only in this version;
	- placeholders;
	- DBMS agnostic interface;
	- Models with relations;
- ... will be much more soon ...
